# Carousel-Challenge App

The app consumes data from an endpoint. Tha data provided by the endpoint is an array of objects. Each object has two properties: Title (string) and Images (array) => carousel blocks.

When clicking on previous/next buttons, a random image will be displayed from next/previous carousels block.

## Installation

For this project, we will be using Expo CLI to create the React Native App.
We need to install Expo CLI

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

To install the dependencies,

```bash
yarn install
```

To run the project

```bash
expo start
```

If you want to try it on your mobile, download Expo Go app from Google Play (Android) or App Store (iOS), go to the app and scan the QR code provided by the Expo
.
Running an emulator is a very resource-intensive task and requires a high-end system. (I personally, do not recommend it)
